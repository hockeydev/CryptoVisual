# Cryptovisual
Visualisation of all CryptoCurrencies listed on CoinGecko - Using 3d-force-graph and CoinGecko API.


This was created with the use of 3d-force-graph, a fantastic library you can find here https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph/blob/master/README.md#data-input
Data was pulled using the CoinGecko API. I had to pre-format the data and edit it slightly to work with 3d-force-graph but im working on putting it all together to pull live data from the API. CoinGeck API can be found here https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#explore-api
